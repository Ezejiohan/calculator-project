🧮 Python Calculator Application

This is a simple command-line calculator built with Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and continue calculations using the previous result, just like a real calculator.

🎯 Objective

To perform basic mathematical operations while demonstrating the use of functions, dictionaries, loops, and recursion in Python.

🧠 Features

Supports basic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Uses a dictionary to map operators to functions

Allows continuous calculations with the previous result

Option to start a new calculation

Displays an ASCII art logo at startup

🧠 How the Program Works

The calculator starts by displaying a logo from the art module.

The user enters the first number.

Available operations are displayed.

The user selects an operation and enters the next number.

The result is calculated and displayed.

The user can:

Continue calculating with the current result

Start a new calculation

The process repeats until the user exits.

🧠 Concepts Used

Functions

Dictionaries (mapping operators to functions)

Loops (while, for)

Conditional statements

User input handling

Recursion

Modular imports (art)
